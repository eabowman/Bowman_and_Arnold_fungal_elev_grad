To execute these files, you will need to download and install R and R studio.
The latest version of R can be downloaded at https://www.r-project.org/ and R studio desktop at https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/#Desktop. 

Once install, open up 'Load_packages.R' script in R Studio. This file will install and
load all packages used in analyses.
